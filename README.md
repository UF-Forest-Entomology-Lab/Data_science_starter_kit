# Data_science_starter_kit
This is our introductory repo for getting started on data sciency stuff. 


# Things we think are important:
* Mathematics & statistics
* Programming
* Data Manipulation & Exploration
* Machine learning
* Data visualization
* Domain Knowledge

# Programming starter kit:
* Git
Git and Github are essential for sharing and storing code. It is the industry standard for a good reason.

* Virtual environments
Virtual environments are the best way to compartmentalise code and reproduce code between machines.

# My first machine learning model:
* Get data
* Clean data (pandas)
* reduce dimensionality & extract features (scikit-learn)
* Apply ML technique (scikit-learn)
